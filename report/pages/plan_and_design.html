        <h1>Plan and Design</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of my system is to monitor environmental conditions in forests that contribute to wildfire risk
            (temperature, humidity, light) and provide early warnings when dangerous thresholds are exceeded. A
            Python-based model will predict fire risk over time by analysing patterns in collected data and adapting
            predictions as new environmental data becomes available.  </p>
            <h2>Design Objectives</h2>
            <p>I will include environmental sensors such as humidity, temperature and light speed, and can be turned on or
                off by buttons on the micro: bit. I will then calculate and display the risk score on LED screen and alert
                using buzzer if risk is not low. (BR1)  
                <br><br>
                Then, I will record sensor data and risk level using serial connection periodically, in the rate of 2
                seconds per row. (BR2)  
                <br><br>
                To simulate a forest-related risk over time, I will gradually increase the temperature around the micro: bit
                gradually to above 40°C, and observe how the system updates the risk level, with the output showing the risk
                score increasing as temperature readings worsen. (BR3) 
                <br><br>
                 After that, I will create a rule-based model realised by a scoring system, used to predict wildfire risk
                with consideration of more factors, such as amount of flammable litter. I will also send a set of data from
                the micro: bit to the model and analyse it. (AR1) 
                <br><br>
                 I will simulate sets of data will represent situations like “what if there is severe drought?" and “what if
                the temperature rises drastically?”. Next, I will input into the model to see if there is a change in risk.
                (AR2)  
                <br><br>
                Finally, I will read a CSV file containing time-stamped input data, calculate the risks, and compare them
                with the previous results. (AR3) 
            </p>
            <h2>Project Options</h2>
            <p>I have considered two options of data collection, one being alert-triggered and the other being regular
                records. 
                <br><br>
                Alert-triggered logging outputs data via serial connection only when the risk score is above a threshold,
                e.g. alert every time when score jumps from 2 to 3. The benefits include avoiding redundant data. However,
                it is possible that no data is being logged for a long period, making the logging system unresponsive.  
                <br><br>
                Time-based logging outputs data repeatedly after a specified period, e.g. output a line every 2 seconds. It
                offers a direct overview of the status all the time, and the data is suitable for further analysis even if
                no fire risk appears. On the other hand, it may store too much unused data, using storage unnecessarily. 
            </p>
            <h2>Justification of Design Choices</h2>
            <p>I choose time-base logging for several reasons. It gives the ability to test the system’s ability to record
                and store data under normal conditions such as room temperature. It also provides suitable data for the
                model to predict the risk with further consideration.  It also allows me to debug the data-logging function
                more easily. </p>
                <h2>Stakeholders and End Users</h2>
                <p>The stakeholders of this system include researchers and organizations who are interested in the fire risk of
                    the selected area. They need regularly collected data and a sample method to predict the fire risk.  They
                    can utilize the data collected to model the fire risk according to their own understanding. The system
                    provides time-based logging of sensor data, and a modelling interpretation that presents analysis in a
                    comprehensible way.  
                    <br><br>
                    The end users are teachers or travel organisers who are interested in fire probabilities. These people need
                    a simple way of measuring if the selected area is safe for outdoor activities. The system and model can help
                    them predict it easily.
