        <h1>Investigation</h1>
        <h2>Investigating The Brief </h2>
        <p>Forests support critical ecological balance by filtering water, providing oxygen through photosynthesis, etc.
            <br><br>
            Wildfires have been increasingly pervasive factor in causing forest loss <a href="#r1">[1]</a>. They have
            received great attention
            throughout the world and being monitored in a variety of ways <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            <br><br>
            People have been estimating the probability of wildfires using different models. Some private institutions
            manage to calculate “Fire radiative power” for the area at concern, i.e., speed of fuel consumption, to
            predict the risk. Global collaboration on the topic is also taking place, which provides information such as
            burnt areas and real-time fire reports, to conclude a set of fire forecasts <a href="#r3">[3]</a>.
            <br><br>
            Some environmental factors such as moisture affect fire risk directly, by providing suitable conditions for
            flames to occur. Other factors, such as light, imply these factors, e.g., lower light intensity may be cause
            by clouds, potentially leads to cooler and wetter environments.
            <br><br>
            I have been intrigued to investigate wildfire risks by using both kinds of environmental factors, e.g.,
            moisture, light, temperature to simulate the probability of wildfire happening in one specific area. I will
            then build a rule-based model to summarise both environmental and artificial factors in relation to wildfire
            risks.
        </p>
        <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
        <p>NASA has provided a fire information system. It uses satellite data to gather the distribution, duration and
            other key information of wildfires in real time. Then, it uses rule-based modelling to predict fire risks.
            E.g., places near detected fires are more likely to be ignited. It provides an accurate and comprehensive
            view of wildfire status. However, it may not respond in time, as satellites can only scan when they are
            above the target area, creating temporal time gaps.
            <br><br>
            Apart from satellites, Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with optical or thermal cameras are also
            used to detect and model fire risk. These vehicles can not only monitor factors such as humidity but also
            move in specially designed routes to get data from more areas. Similarly, they also use rule-based modelling
            to predict the risk in selected areas. A great advantage is its temporal flexibility, allowing surveillance
            with least latency. But they also suffer from low flight durations (approx. 3hrs) and risk of being damaged
            <a href="#r4">[4]</a>.
            <br><br>
            Private tech companies such as Ororatech have created complex models which simulate the fire spread. It
            includes many advanced factors such as elevation from satellite data and geographical maps, uses a range of
            mathematical models and rule-based models to give detailed predictions. One big advantage is that it
            provides hourly forecast up to 12 hours. However, it is aimed commercially, meaning it requires substantial
            calculating power and a high price <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Research Informed Decision</h2>
        <p>
            As my research showed, we need a solution with frequent monitoring of environmental factors and requires
            less calculating power. I decide to collect temperature, humidity and light intensity data from the
            environment, as they are easy to be monitored. 
            <br><br>
            I am inspired to simulate a situation where heat rises rapidly. This comes from the NASA satellite map
            that numerous fires occur in low-latitude areas, where heat-rising situations are prevalent. 
            <br><br>
            I chose rule-based modelling as my research showed various influences the environmental factors have on
            wildfires. A range of simple rules can generally represent all these influences. 
        </p>
        <h2>Final Idea</h2>
        <p>I decided to build an embedded system and a model which measures several tangible factors of wildfires, to
            predict the risk and warn the users.
            <br><br>
            One limitation is that the embedded system can only monitor and reflect status of a limited area.
