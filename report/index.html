        <h1>Investigation</h1>
        <h2>Investigating The Brief </h2>
        <p>Forests support critical ecological balance by filtering water, providing oxygen through photosynthesis, etc.
            <br><br>
            Wildfires have been increasingly pervasive factor in causing forest loss <a href="#r1">[1]</a>. They have
            received great attention
            throughout the world and being monitored in a variety of ways <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
            <br><br>
            People have been estimating the probability of wildfires using different models. Some private institutions
            manage to calculate “Fire radiative power” for the area at concern, i.e., speed of fuel consumption, to
            predict the risk. Global collaboration on the topic is also taking place, which provides information such as
            burnt areas and real-time fire reports, to conclude a set of fire forecasts <a href="#r3">[3]</a>.
            <br><br>
            Some environmental factors such as moisture affect fire risk directly, by providing suitable conditions for
            flames to occur. Other factors, such as light, imply these factors, e.g., lower light intensity may be cause
            by clouds, potentially leads to cooler and wetter environments.
            <br><br>
            I have been intrigued to investigate wildfire risks by using both kinds of environmental factors, e.g.,
            moisture, light, temperature to simulate the probability of wildfire happening in one specific area. I will
            then build a rule-based model to summarise both environmental and artificial factors in relation to wildfire
            risks.
        </p>
        <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
        <p>NASA has provided a fire information system. It uses satellite data to gather the distribution, duration and
            other key information of wildfires in real time. Then, it uses rule-based modelling to predict fire risks.
            E.g., places near detected fires are more likely to be ignited. It provides an accurate and comprehensive
            view of wildfire status. However, it may not respond in time, as satellites can only scan when they are
            above the target area, creating temporal time gaps.
            <br><br>
            Apart from satellites, Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with optical or thermal cameras are also
            used to detect and model fire risk. These vehicles can not only monitor factors such as humidity but also
            move in specially designed routes to get data from more areas. Similarly, they also use rule-based modelling
            to predict the risk in selected areas. A great advantage is its temporal flexibility, allowing surveillance
            with least latency. But they also suffer from low flight durations (approx. 3hrs) and risk of being damaged
            <a href="#r4">[4]</a>..
            <br><br>
            Private tech companies such as Ororatech have created complex models which simulate the fire spread. It
            includes many advanced factors such as elevation from satellite data and geographical maps, uses a range of
            mathematical models and rule-based models to give detailed predictions. One big advantage is that it
            provides hourly forecast up to 12 hours. However, it is aimed commercially, meaning it requires substantial
            calculating power and a high price <a href="#r5">[5]</a>..
        </p>
        <h2>Research Informed Decision</h2>
        <p>
            As my research showed, we need a solution with frequent monitoring of environmental factors and requires
            less calculating power. I decide to collect temperature, humidity and light intensity data from the
            environment, as they are easy to be monitored. 
            <br><br>
            I am inspired to simulate a situation where heat rises rapidly. This comes from the NASA satellite map
            that numerous fires occur in low-latitude areas, where heat-rising situations are prevalent. 
            <br><br>
            I chose rule-based modelling as my research showed various influences the environmental factors have on
            wildfires. A range of simple rules can generally represent all these influences. 
        </p>
        <h2>Final Idea</h2>
        <p>I decided to build an embedded system and a model which measures several tangible factors of wildfires, to
            predict the risk and warn the users.
            <br><br>
            One limitation is that the embedded system can only monitor and reflect status of a limited area.

        <h1>Plan and Design</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of my system is to monitor environmental conditions in forests that contribute to wildfire risk
            (temperature, humidity, light) and provide early warnings when dangerous thresholds are exceeded. A
            Python-based model will predict fire risk over time by analysing patterns in collected data and adapting
            predictions as new environmental data becomes available.  </p>
        <h2>Design Objectives</h2>
        <p>I will include environmental sensors such as humidity, temperature and light speed, and can be turned on or
            off by buttons on the micro: bit. I will then calculate and display the risk score on LED screen and alert
            using buzzer if risk is not low. (BR1)  
            <br><br>
            Then, I will record sensor data and risk level using serial connection periodically, in the rate of 2
            seconds per row. (BR2)  
            <br><br>
            To simulate a forest-related risk over time, I will gradually increase the temperature around the micro: bit
            gradually to above 40°C, and observe how the system updates the risk level, with the output showing the risk
            score increasing as temperature readings worsen. (BR3) 
            <br><br>
             After that, I will create a rule-based model realised by a scoring system, used to predict wildfire risk
            with consideration of more factors, such as amount of flammable litter. I will also send a set of data from
            the micro: bit to the model and analyse it. (AR1) 
            <br><br>
             I will simulate sets of data will represent situations like “what if there is severe drought?" and “what if
            the temperature rises drastically?”. Next, I will input into the model to see if there is a change in risk.
            (AR2)  
            <br><br>
            Finally, I will read a CSV file containing time-stamped input data, calculate the risks, and compare them
            with the previous results. (AR3) 
        </p>
        <h2>Project Options</h2>
        <p>I have considered two options of data collection, one being alert-triggered and the other being regular
            records. 
            <br><br>
            Alert-triggered logging outputs data via serial connection only when the risk score is above a threshold,
            e.g. alert every time when score jumps from 2 to 3. The benefits include avoiding redundant data. However,
            it is possible that no data is being logged for a long period, making the logging system unresponsive.  
            <br><br>
            Time-based logging outputs data repeatedly after a specified period, e.g. output a line every 2 seconds. It
            offers a direct overview of the status all the time, and the data is suitable for further analysis even if
            no fire risk appears. On the other hand, it may store too much unused data, using storage unnecessarily. 
        </p>
        <h2>Justification of Design Choices</h2>
        <p>I choose time-base logging for several reasons. It gives the ability to test the system’s ability to record
            and store data under normal conditions such as room temperature. It also provides suitable data for the
            model to predict the risk with further consideration.  It also allows me to debug the data-logging function
            more easily. </p>
        <h2>Stakeholders and End Users</h2>
        <p>The stakeholders of this system include researchers and organizations who are interested in the fire risk of
            the selected area. They need regularly collected data and a sample method to predict the fire risk.  They
            can utilize the data collected to model the fire risk according to their own understanding. The system
            provides time-based logging of sensor data, and a modelling interpretation that presents analysis in a
            comprehensible way.  
            <br><br>
            The end users are teachers or travel organisers who are interested in fire probabilities. These people need
            a simple way of measuring if the selected area is safe for outdoor activities. The system and model can help
            them predict it easily.
