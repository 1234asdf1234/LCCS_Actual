The dataset comes from the research paper:
Cortez, Paulo and Morais, Aníbal.
"A Data Mining Approach to Predict Forest Fires using Meteorological Data."
In Proceedings of the 13th EPIA 2007 – Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
pp. 512–523, 2007.
It was collected in Montesinho Natural Park, located in the northeast of Portugal.
The dataset was contributed to the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is the official public distributor of the data.
1. X
Type: Integer
Meaning: X-axis spatial coordinate (1–9) within the Montesinho park map grid (Portugal).
Use: Locates the fire event on a coarse grid.
2. Y
Type: Integer
Meaning: Y-axis spatial coordinate (1–9), forming a 9×9 spatial grid together with X.
Use: Spatial modeling, capturing terrain or regional effects.
3. month
Type: Categorical (string: "jan" … "dec")
Meaning: Month of the fire occurrence.
Use: Seasonal patterns, weather-dependent risk variations.
4. day
Type: Categorical (string: "mon" … "sun")
Meaning: Day of the week.
Use: May correlate with human activity (ignitions, suppression).
5. FFMC
Type: Numeric
Meaning: Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FWI component).
Interpretation: Indicates moisture content of litter and fine fuels;
Higher = more flammable, dry fine fuels.
Range in dataset: Typically ~18–101.
6. DMC
Type: Numeric
Meaning: Duff Moisture Code (FWI component).
Interpretation: Medium-term drying of compact organic layers;
Higher = drier duff = higher fire potential.
7. DC
Type: Numeric
Meaning: Drought Code (FWI component).
Interpretation: Long-term dryness of deep fuels;
Higher = severe drought conditions.
8. ISI
Type: Numeric
Meaning: Initial Spread Index (FWI component).
Interpretation: Indicates expected initial rate of fire spread;
Computed from wind + FFMC.
Higher = faster potential spread.
9. temp
Type: Numeric (°C)
Meaning: Temperature at noon.
Use: Key predictor of fire risk.
10. RH
Type: Numeric (%)
Meaning: Relative humidity at noon.
Interpretation:
Lower RH = drier fuels = higher fire danger.
11. wind
Type: Numeric (km/h)
Meaning: Wind speed at noon.
Use: Fire spread potential (higher wind → faster spread).
12. rain
Type: Numeric (mm/m²)
Meaning: Rainfall in the last 24 hours.
Use: Mitigates fire ignition/spread (non-zero values are rare).
13. area
Type: Numeric (hectares)
Meaning: Burned area of the forest fire.
Notes:
Many entries are 0, representing very small fires.
Highly skewed distribution — often modelled with log(1+area).
Use: The main prediction target for fire severity.
